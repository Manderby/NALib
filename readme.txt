NALib is a collection of source files written in the programming language C
which contains code like system-dependent macros, high-performance functions
and modern container structs. It is based on a C++ library which had been used
during 10 years in research and has then been transferred to C over the past
5 years and been verified continuously in selling products for the industry
and consumer market. The code also contains many didactical comments which
explain why the soure code is written as it is.

NALib is short for "Not A Library", which means that NALib is not distributed
as a static or dynamic library, but only as source files.

- Simply include the whole NALib folder into your project.
- NALib just needs the standard libraries.
- Use NDEBUG for testing.

Documentation:
--------------
Can be found directly within the source files.
Some design principles can be read in the doc/documentation.txt file.

Contribute:
-----------
This project has so far not been designed with a community in mind, as it has
been used as a private engineering code collection. Therefore, be gentle and
patient.
