NALib is a collection of source files written in the C programming language
which contains code like system-dependent macros, high-performance functions
and container structs, a small runtime system with memory pools and optional
reference counting and many helpful comments.

It evolved since 2004, using a very modern coding style using C11 features but
at the same time being compatible back to ANSI-C (except for the // comments).
It had been used in research, consumer market and industry where it had been
verified continuously in selling products.

Current version is 23.
Branch "version24" contains the latest developments.

Installation:
--------------
NALib is short for "Not A Library", which means that NALib is not distributed
as a static or dynamic library, but only as source files.

- Simply include the whole NALib folder into your project.
- NALib just needs the standard libraries.
- Compilation of the whole collection usually takes less than 5 seconds.

Documentation:
--------------
- Can be found directly within the source files.
- Some design principles can be read in the doc/documentation.txt file.

Contribute:
-----------
This project has so far not been designed with a community in mind, as it has
been used as a private engineering code collection. Therefore, be gentle and
patient.
