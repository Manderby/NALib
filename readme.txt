NALib is a collection of source files written in the C programming language
which contains code like system-dependent macros, high-performance functions
and container structs, a small runtime system with memory pools and optional
reference counting and many helpful comments.

It evolved since 2004, using a very modern coding style using C11 features but
at the same time being compatible back to ANSI-C (except for the // comments).
It had been used in research, consumer market and industry where it had been
verified continuously in selling products.

Master contains the latest developments on Version 24.
Older release versions are available as tags.

Installation:
--------------
NALib is short for "Not A Library", which means that NALib is not distributed
as a static or dynamic library, but only as source files.

- Simply include the whole NALib folder into your project.
- NALib just needs the standard libraries.
- Compilation of the whole collection usually takes less than 5 seconds.

Documentation:
--------------
- Can be found directly within the source files.
- Some design principles can be read in the doc/documentation.txt file.

Contribute:
-----------
This project has so far not been designed with a community in mind, as it has
been used as a private engineering code collection. Therefore, be gentle and
patient.
