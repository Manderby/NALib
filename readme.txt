Hello GitHub users

This is NALib, short for "Not A Library".

NALib is a collection of source files written in the programming language C which contains code like system-dependent macros, high-performance functions and modern container structs. It is based on a C++ library which had been used during 10 years in research and has then been transferred to C over the past 5 years and been verified continuously in selling products for the industry and consumer market. The code also contains many didactical comments which explain why the soure code is written as it is.

NALib is short for "Not A Library", which means that NALib is not distributed as static od dynamic library, but only as source files. Copy everything into your project, compile and be happy. Any other usage is not encuraged.

Documentation:
See doc folder. Everything else is written directly in the h files.

This project has so far not been designed with a community in mind, as it has been used as a private engineering code collection. Therefore, be gentle and patient. You may send suggestions, I don't get mad if you ask. But don't expect me to rejoye if you bombard me with fundamental quirks. This has always been and shall remain a professional engineering code collection.
