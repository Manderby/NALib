CHANGELOG Versions 20 - 30
--------------------------

This file contains information about changes in the package NALib. These are
purely informational and any information found here is not guaranteed to be
correct, complete or final.


Version 21 (first published 2018-xxx-xx)
==========

- Enhanced runtime system with Reference counting for naNew, naRetain and
  naRelease. Revisited whole NARuntime. Now no code sanity warnings.
- Added Binary operators for more control over integer and floating point
  values.
- NAQuadTree is now storing coordinates in doubles.
- Renaming of NASystem to NABase. Split-up of the file into a folder of files.
  Oldest file in the code collection grew constantly and desperately needed
  some structure.
- Huge refactoring concerning integer values. Created int 64 emulation. It is
  possible now to compile the code without long long.

- The Runtime system now always registers runtime types, not only in debug.
- Added NA_MEMORY_POOL_AGGRESSIVE_CLEANUP macro in NAConfiguration.h
- Removed NA_RUNTIME_USES_MEMORY_POOLS in NAConfiguration.h. Pools rule!
- Moved implementation macros to II files.
- Some more debugging tests
- QuadTree and Octtree added childlength to update function callbacks. Also
  have new function to return rect or box of current iterator element and
  aligned coords
- Some float function names have changed the position of their f suffix.
- Enhanced Coord.h with some more double, float and int conversions.
- Enhanced and corrected many more NACoord functions
- Enhanced value helpers with some more conversions.
- Added NA_MEMORY_ALIGNED_MEM_MAC_OS_X macro to Configuration.h
- naCrash is now a macro. No more code analysis warnings.
- Removed all occurrencies of the old company in the code.
- Introcuding NASizeInt and NASizeUInt. Since NAInt does not necessarily has
  the same size as an address, we needed that.
- SYSTEM is only used for macros concerning the actual system compiled for.
  NA_OS defined the operating system, NA_CALENDAR defines the calendar system.
- Cleaned up some h files.


Version 20 (first published 2018-Jan-13):
==============================================

This changelog file starts with NALib version 20.

A full changelog of version 20 and earlier versions are described in other
files. Here, only a recapitulation of the most important things of verisoins
10 to 20 is described:

In between versions 10 and 20, lots of refinements have been made, some APIs
have been simplified and many changes have been introduced. Most importantly,
the iterators have been reimplemented to a common form, the memory management
and runtime system became more powerful, faster and aware of garbage collection,
container structs became simpler yet more powerful, new containers have been
introduced, and a first UI implementation has been programmed.
