CHANGELOG Versions 0 - 10
-------------------------

This file contains information about changes in the package NALib. These are
purely informational and any information found here is not guaranteed to be
correct, complete or final.



Version 10 (first published 2015-July-1):
==============================================

Highlights:
- Complete revisit of NAString. Lots of changes. Certain APIs have not been
  reenabled just yet. Do not upgrade if you rely on certain XML or parse
  functions.
- Complete redesign of memory structure. Added a small runtime system for
  pool allocation of NAString and NAPointer structs.
- naCreateXXX functions are now called naInitXXX functions and do take a
  pointer as first argument which must be non-null! Creation of such pointers
  can either be done with malloc, naMalloc, naAlloc, naNew or by providing
  a pointer to an existing struct.
- Added NAQuadTree. A structure storing integer quad trees with arbitrary
  contents and many callbacks
- Added NAPool (yet undocumented)
- Added NAStack (yet undocumented)

Other things:
- Changed all naCreateString methods to naNewString
- Renamed naDuplicateList to naCopyList
- Removed naAllocNALibStruct
- Renamed NAPointerContent to NALValue. Added null-termination and array
  detection.
- NAPointer only works with the Runtime System: Renamed naCreatePointer to
  naNewPointer
- Renamed naAllocateXXX functions to naMallocXXX. Added naFree.
- Changed and renamed naAllocNALibStruct to naAlloc. Now unconditional alloc.
- naDestroyXXX functions have been removed. Use naFree or free to deallocate.
- Added NA_INVALID_MEMORY_INDEX to NAByteArray
- String escaping has been removed
- Added naGetSystemMemoryPageSize and naGetSystemMemoryPageSizeMask,
  naAllocatePageAligned and naFreePageAligned, naGetZeroFillSize,
  naIsByteArrayZeroTerminated
- Changed some parameter types of various functions
- Removed lots of pedantic warnings
- Renamed NA_UNUSED_PARAMETER to NA_UNUSED
- Added naMakePosiWithAlignment, naGetRectiEndPos, naGetRectiMaxPos
- Changed naGetRectiIndexOfPosi to naGetRectiIndexOfPosiRowFirst and added
  ColumnFirst and made the return type unsigned
- Fixed an awkward error in NAPointer which caused data to be not owned.
- Fixed a memory leak in naCreateStringFromFileContents
- Altered naAppendString functions to naCreateString functions and fixed
  some potential memory leaks.
- Added euler constant 2.718...
- added naIsInfinity



Version 9 (first published 2015-April-30):
==============================================

Highlights:
- Redesigned iteration functions of NAList
- Added NAPointerContent, a pointer storing const or mutable data.
- Added NAURL. Still very rough, but it's a start.
- Made several changes to NAString: naCreateStringWithMutableUTF8Buffer can
  receive a negative size to define that the string is null-terminated.
  Deleted naCreateStringWithSize, naGetStringMutableUTF8Pointer and
  naGetStringMutableChar. Altered naGetStringConstUTF8Pointer and
  naGetStringConstChar to naGetStringUTF8Pointer and naGetStringChar. Therefore
  an NAString is now always const after creation.
  Consequently changed implementations in NABitArray, NAFile, NAString.
- NABitArray has been removed from this package. Was way too specific to be
  in a code collection
- NAHeap now stores const or mutable data. A new flag defines if the heap
  stores backPointers or not. Even faster than before!

Other things:
- Made NA_API and NA_DEF hidden
- Added NA_API and NA_DEF for String and File functions
- Added NA_SQRT3
- Simplified NAPointer according using the new NAPointerContent
- Added naAllocNALibStruct, an internal macro for simplification and maybe
  (maybe!) future garbage collection.
- Added naNullV functions to nullify vectors.
- Added naGetHeapCount, deleted naIsHeapEmpty
- Added NA_HAPI, NA_HDEF, NA_HIAPI and NA_HIDEF macros
- Added NAUInt, an unsigned integer with 32 or 64 Bits. Changed many functions
  now accepting or returning an NAUInt instead of an NAInt. Todo: recheck all
  inputs to not exceed the max value of a signed int where necessary.
- Changed naMakePositiveiInSize to return two NAUInt pointers.
- Removed NA_DIRECTORY_DELIMITER and added NA_PATH_DELIMITER
- Added naParseStringPathComponent, naCreateStringWithBasenameOfFilename,
  naCreateStringWithSuffixOfFilename
- Added NAArray.c implementation file and moved some functions there.
- Several implementation changes in NAArray. Added helper function for empty
  array and Constructor calls. Added naForeachArray.
- Added NAMutator function pointer type for interation.
- Added naSwap for more base types
- Added iterator for NAGrowingSpace. Deleted naGetGrowingSpaceConstElement
  and naGetGrowingSpaceMutableElement
- Added naIsListAtFirst and naIsListAtLast
- Added naLocateListIndex.
- Re-Added a version macro NA_VERSION
- Changed the test.c file. Very small. Just a version printout.




Version 8 (first published 2015-February-28):
==============================================

Highlights:
- Complete reorganization of NAMinMax, NARange, NAPos, NASize and NARect.
  All is dependent on NAMinMax now and there is a distinction between
  min-max and start-end.
- Continued NAHeap implementation. Removed an awkward error which
  caused the NAHeap structure to not do its job at all. Now works with
  multiple key types and both as min and max heap.
- Added Constructor callbacks. More to come. Readme file changed.
- Reimplemented NAGrowingSpace. It now stores the content in a growing
  list of NAByteArrays. Advantage: The elements always keep their address.
  Disadvantage: NAGrowingSpace can no longer be accessed like an array.
  Will need to implement iteraters sooner or later. Not yet perfect but
  API fit for the future.
- Moved many inline functions of NAByteArray to an implementation file
  and made them non-inline.

Other things:
- Changed naAllocate and naCreatePointerWithSize such that negative sizes
  can be given. If size is negative, the latest Bytes are filled with Null.
- Added Constructor to NAGrowingSpace creator.
- Changed naNewGrowingSpaceElement. No more indexes.
- Removed naAddGrowingSpaceElement, naGetGrowingSpaceConstPointer and
  naGetGrowingSpaceMutablePointer, naDuplicateGrowingSpace
- Added Destructor to NAList destructor
- Added naMakeDateTimeWithNALibSecondNumber
- Added a cplusplus macro for isnan which is necessary on Mac OS X
- Added naMakeRectWithRectAndBorder and naMakeRectiWithRectiAndBorder
- Added another check for null terminated strings
- Added naCreateStringWithMutableUTF8Buffer
- Added naLocateListElement and changed some macros in the file
- Remove functions of NAList now return a pointer to the content
- Added latest leap second according tu bulletin C 49
- Moved many basic functions to NAMathOperators.h
- Renamed IsInside to Inside
- Renamed some symbols containing From to With
- Removed NA_INVALID_MEMORY_INDEX
- Re-entered return instructions after naCrash calls.
- Improvement of some comments and some error checks

- Added a clang specific macro check in naAllocate
- Added NA_NORETURN. naCrash is now a _Noreturn function and crashes
  deliberately. Reorganized naCrash and successive naError calls. Most
  return instructions after the naCrash call have been erased.

was introduced.

- Revisited the NA_API and related macros. Tried to make it more logically.
- Added array-reading and -writing for basic datatypes in NAFile.
- Moved the autoflush and newline macros of NAFile.h to the implementation
