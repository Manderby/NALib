CHANGELOG Versions 10 - 20
--------------------------

This file contains information about changes in the package NALib. These are
purely informational and any information found here is not guaranteed to be
correct, complete or final.





Highlights:
- Added CODATA 2014 from NIST for physical constants
- Added Leap Second entry according to bulletin C 50
- Added third dimension to NACoord.h: NAVertex, NAVolume and NABox. Moved
  NARange to the same file. Consequently, generalizing some APIs.
- Greatly documented NAQuadTree and changed implementation to be non-redundant.
  Some API changes introduced.
- Added NAOctTree
- Renamed all naCpyXXX to naCopyXXX. Renamed all naSetXXX to naFillXXX which
  are not state machine functions.
- Changed all NAVecXXX and NAMatXXX parameters to their direct pointer
  equivalent. For example NAVec3f now is typed float*
- Added Quaternion 3D rotations in naFillM33WithRotationAlongAxis and
  naFillM33WithRotationAngles in NAVectorAlgebra.h

Other things:
- Added macro check for c++ standard keyword detection.
- Changed count value of NAList to NAUInt
- Added another macro check for va_copy
- Moved NAPointer to NARuntime.h, renamed NAPointer.h to NAMemory.h
- Added intersection functions to naCoord.h
- Added Iteration for naQuadTree and naOctTree. Removed obsolete GrowingSpace
  functions consequently. Iteration is way faster!
- Removed naFillRangeXXX, naInsideRange and naAlmostInsideRange functions.
- Removed NARectArea.h, NARectArea.c, NAMinMax.h, NAMinMax.c and NARange.h
  Consequently, moved some functions elsewhere or deleted them.
- NAByteMap.h and NAMap2D.h are not deleted yet. We'll see how these files
  turn out in the near future.
- Added NA_ZERO, NA_ONE, naIsIntStrictlyPositive, naIsIntZero, naIsIntNegative
- NAUTF8Char is now typedefed as NAByte. Macro check for Bytes being 8 bits
  wide moved to NASystem.h
- Changed NA_SYMBOL_VISIBLE and NA_SYMBOL_HIDDEN to NA_LINKER_EXPORT and
  NA_LINKER_NO_EXPORT
- Removed naNewPointerStruct. Moved code directly to the other constructors.
- Removed naGetPointerLValue.
- Replaced naNewPointerWithConstBuffer and naNewPointerWithMutableBuffer with
  naNewPointerWithLValue.
- Changed naFillLValueXXX functions to naMakeLValueXXX
- Added more C-standard macros and made many definitions dependent on that.
- Made some benchmarks and therefore added a custom pool size instead of
  relying on the memory page size. Added NA_POOL_SIZE_EQUALS_PAGESIZE and
  NA_CUSTOM_POOL_SIZE.
- Removed string encoding. NALib currently is only capable to handle UTF-8.
  It is just too much to rewrite all encodings from scratch. For now.
- Added naLog2i
- NAQuadTree now expands in 4 cycles such that a tree will always be the same
  no matter how he is constructed.
- naSeedRand now returns the seed created when using 0




Version 10 (first published 2015-July-1):
==============================================

This changelog file starts with NALib version 10.

A full changelog of version 10 and earlier versions are described in other
files. Here, only a recapitulation of the most important things of NALib is
described:

NALib is a source code collection provided with a very open license for
everyone to use. It is a pure C library which has been derived from a private
C++ library more than a decade in the making.

NALib provides code for various data formats and algorithms commonly used
every day in a software engineers work. It compiles with clang and gcc on
Mac OS X as well as with Visual-C on Windows. Other systems may or may not
be supported. The collection has been used to drive several commercial
applications on Mac and Windows.

During the first 10 version iterations, continuous improvements have been made
in order to simplify the API, add code safety, provide debugging helpers and
to enhance the collection. From the start, the documentation of NALib was
embedded withing the source files, mainly the header files. The documentation
is supposed to be didactical for people to understand what is going on in the
code and which API should be used under what circumstances.
